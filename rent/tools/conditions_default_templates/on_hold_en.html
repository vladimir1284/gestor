<h4>
    Retention Deposit Conditions:
</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
    The <mark class="marker-yellow"><u>${{ deposit.amount|floatformat:'-2' }}</u></mark> retention deposit guarantees the reservation of the trailer for a period of <mark class="marker-yellow"><u>{{ deposit.days }} {%if deposit.days == 1%}day{%else%}days{%endif%}</u></mark> from the payment date. If the client does not collect the trailer within this period, the deposit will be forfeited as compensation. Should an extension of the retention period be required, the client may make additional payments, which will also be non-refundable if the trailer is not collected. If the client collects the trailer within the agreed period, the retention deposit will be applied to the security deposit required for the rental. The rental agreement formally begins on the day the client collects the trailer.
